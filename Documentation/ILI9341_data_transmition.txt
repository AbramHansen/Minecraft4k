Notes on ILI9341 data transmition
Documentation URL: http://www.lcdwiki.com/res/MSP2807/ILI9341%20Datasheet.pdf

Pages of note:
	how a pixel is sent (16 bit representation): 63
	write cycle sequence: 33-35
	page address set command: 112

We will use 4 wire mode
	PA1 - Reset
	PA4 - Chip Select (CS / CSX)
	PA5 - Serial Clock (SCL)
	PA6 - Data/Command (D/CX)
	PA7 - MOSI (SDA / data)

SPI settings:
	Data Size = 8bits
	MSB First
	Prescaller is set currently to 8, but can be lowered in the future to speed up refresh rate.
	Check CPOL/Mode setting!

DMA settings:
	Data Width = 8bits
	Increment Memory Address
	Source: Memory 
	Destination: SPI1
	Priority: High
	Possibly enable circular mode?

Notes:
	HAL_SPI_Transmit_DMA(&hspi, txBuffer, sizeof(txBuffer));
